# Cross-linking

To allow cross-linking between documents on Exercism, a special type of Markdown link can be used. Instead of display a link to the cross-linked document, we'll render a widget that can be hovered over to show the contents of the linked document.

### Link to: Concept

Link format: `[concept:<track-slug>/<concept-slug>]()`

Example:

```markdown
A ternary expression is an alternative to [concept:ruby/if-statements].
```
