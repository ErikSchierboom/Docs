# Cross-linking

To allow cross-linking between documents on Exercism, a special type of Markdown link can be used. Instead of display a link to the cross-linked document, we'll render a widget that can be hovered over to show the contents of the linked document.

## Documents

The following documents can be cross-linked to using a custom link:

- `[<track-slug>:concept:<concept-slug>]()`: refer to the concept with the specified slug (e.g. `[ruby:concept:if-statements]`).
